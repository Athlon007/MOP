### Changes

- Minor under the hood improvements
- "Shadow Distance" slider won't be displayed, if "Adjust Shadows" toggle is not checked

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed occassional lag after loading the game, caused by Satsuma rigidbody being enabled when it should not be
- Fixed crashing sounds coming from Satsuma and Jonnez when walking next to them
- Fixed empty plastic cans possibly being unpickable by the player
- Fixed MOP disabling empty items, even when "Disable Empty Items" checkbox was not ticked
- Fixed items despawning too aggressively, if player entered the driving mode and was at home, resulting in items despawing as soon as he entered that mode
