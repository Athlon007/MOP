### Added

- Added "mop reload all" console command, which will load all rule files - regardless if the mod corresponding to it is present or not
- (MSCLoader) MOP will successfully load back, after it was disabled

### Changes

- (MSCLoader) MOP is now loaded in SecondPassOnLoad, instead of PostLoad
- MOP will now load slower, to mitigate issues with textures and engine parts not loading
  - If you want it to load fast again, you can enable "FAST LOADING" option in the MOP Settings under "Other" section

### Bug Fixes

- Possibly fixed kilju bucket lid detaching when left behind
- Further fixes regarding loading of rule files
- Fixed exhaust muffler trigger sometimes not being enabled back when muffler detaches
- Fixed duplicate rule files while using "mop rules" command
- Fixed issues with engine parts and car textures not fully loading
