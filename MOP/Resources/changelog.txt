Added:
- Empty beer bottles can now be removed automatically, right after you drink the beer. Wouldn't that be neat IRL? (You can enable it in the mod settings)
- Added support for GAZ 24 Volga mod, so you can now feel like KGB agent
- Added support for Police Ferndale mod, so you can now feel like police officer
- Added support for VHS Player mod, so you can watch movies about KGB agents and police officers

Changes:
- Improved save game hook, so now now it hooks into jail savegame, even when you're not in jail (which may eventually be a thing)
- Minor changes in the settings

Bug Fixes:
- Excluded Fury from Drivable Fury mod from occlusion culling
- Fixed two shy houses that would disappear when player tried to approach them. We gave them some confindence boost, so they won't disappear :)
- Fishes should now fish properly
- Occlusion shouldn't crash anymore

Removed:
- Removed legacy occlusion method, because it was sooo last season
- Does anyone read these? Hello?
