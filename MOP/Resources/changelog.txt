A lot of people were no complaining that MOP 3.4 is not available for Mod Loader Pro, so guess what? MOP 3.5 is available for BOTH mod loaders!

### Added

- (Mod Loader Pro) Restored tooltips
- (Mod Loader Pro) Restored resolution changing
- Added a warning if you try to run MSCLoader version of MOP on Mod Loader Pro and vice-versa

### 3.5.1

Version bump, because I incorrectly signed the 3.5 :)
