### Changes

- Improved the way foot spoilage is calculated (shouldn't cause the items to immediately spoil)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed MOP showing error about not all parts being installed, if the cylinder head was installed, but the engine block was not
- Fixed item spoilage not working when the level has loaded and the item hasn't been initialized yet
- Fixed compatibility with older game versions that don't have the fuse box
