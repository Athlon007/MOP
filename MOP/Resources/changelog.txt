### Added

- Added command "mop debug_monitor", which shows debug stats of MOP

### Bug Fixes

- MOP won't show errors during save file verification, if the new save file has been created, but  the game hasn't been saved, which made certain save tags missing
- Improved R20 Battery Box transform loading - now it's done when MOP is running, instead of during MOP loading

### Removed

- Removed unused code
- Removed custom rule file flag: "show_garbage_memory_usage"
