Really sorry for everyone that encountered the bug with some elements of yard and other places not loading correctly, but it only happpens to some specific people, at a specific occasion, which I yet have to figure out. 10 other people have been testing MOP 2.9 and nobody reported that issue.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed places LOD not loading correctly for some people
