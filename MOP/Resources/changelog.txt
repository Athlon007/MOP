### Added

- Added Modes of how MOP operates:
  - Pick between Performance, Balanced, Quality or Safe operation modes
  - Performance mode disables elements right "in your face", but gets you a bit more FPS
  - Balanced mode is is intended to balance between obvious disabling of objects, and quality
  - Quality mode tries to hide how MOP disables things, at the cost of speed
- MOP will not execute any heavy operations, if the player is not moving.
- Added "Session ID":
  - GUID based identification system, which will mark this specific session
  - Used mainly for crash log system
- Added "mop open-logs" command
- Garage doors are now being disabled if player is not in the yard area.
- "mop help" command now supports search. You can search for command help by typing "mop help <command_name>", for instance "mop help version" will show you information about "mop version" command, or for instance, type "mop help generate-list" to show the info about "generate list" command
- Added "mop load-rules [true/false]", if set to false, MOP won't load any rule files.
- Rule Files API: Object names with space can be written using quotation marks, instead of using "%20", example: you can use ignore:"The Object" insted of ignore:The%20Object
