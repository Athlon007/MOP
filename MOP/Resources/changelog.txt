This version REQUIRES the MSCLoader!

### Added

- Added three new console commands:
  - 'mop resolution' - Lists all available resolutions
  - 'mop resolution [nOfResolution]' - Sets the resolution from the 'mop resolution' list
  - 'mop force-load-restart [true/false]' - Forces the 'missing Satsuma parts' game reload to happen
- Rule Files API: Added "skip_fury_collider_fix" that makes MOP skip the repair shop missing Fury collider fix

### Changes

- 'mop help' list is now shown alphabetically
- MopSave.json in bug report is now stored in Save folder

### Bug Fixes
