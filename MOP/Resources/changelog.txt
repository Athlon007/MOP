### Added

- MOP Report:
  - Added the number of installed mods
  - Added game window width and height
- "I found a bug button" will now ask you to load the game fully at least once, before generating a bug report
- Added an instruction what to do, if an error occures

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an error, if object that was SatsumaMassManager was hooking didn't have Remove FSM
- Fixed pathfinding of objects in error logs
- Fixed engine renderers not being enabled back on
- Fixed fighting between EngineCulling and ItemBehaviour; In some cases, EngineCulling tried to disable the renderer, while the ItemBehaviour tried to enable it back on. From now on, EngineCulling has a priority over ItemBehaviour
