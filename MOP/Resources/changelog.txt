Bug Fixes:
- Fixed how Hayosiko despawning is managed. From now on, Uncle Stage has to be set to 5, in order for van to fully despawn
- Fixed Gifu diff lock, pump and rear axle being turned on after Gifu respawn
- Fixed flatbed firewood level being reset, after it was filled and then the flatbed got respawned
