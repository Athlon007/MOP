### Added

- Haybales are now toggled
- Added sector at the cottage
- Added sector at the storage room next to kitchen
- Added sector on the driveway (you can enable it only using custom rule file: add flag "driveway_sector")

### Changes

- Slightly changed the home sector
- Rule file flag "ignore" now affects items - it will now prevent disabling of an item, and only allows disabling of the physics and renderers (basically, the old fashioned way)
- Minor changes in how MOP checks if an item is stored in CarryMore inventory
