Note: First game start may take a little longer (depending on how many mods you have), because MOP has to download rule files.

### Added

- Added rule files system!
  - From now on, all mod compatibility is done via the text files with .mopconfig format, dwonloaded from the remote server
  - No need to update MOP in order to add mod compatibility! (At least in most cases)
  - Mod compatibility rules can be updated if needed! MOP checks for rules update every week (you can force new check in the settings)
- Satsuma renderers are now disabled, if not needed
- Satsuma engine renderers are now disabled, if player is in the car, and hood is attached
- Added disclaimer for pirated copies of the game
- Added "Open output log" button into settings
- Added more items to toggled objects

### Changes

- Sectors are now enabled for everyone
- Improved how sectors work
- Some console messages are now colored
- Moved Generate 'Open Last Log' and 'Generate Mod Report' to new category - Logs
- All game objects created by MOP will now have "MOP_" before their name
- Code optimization

### Bug Fixes

- Boat will not disappear/teleport back to the spawn position on respawn
- Fixed doors at home seeming to be open, while in fact they were closed
- Increased toggling distance of water facility, so it doesn't clip on and off when player is on the junction next to school

### Removed

- Removed swamp from toggled world objects
