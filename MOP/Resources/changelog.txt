### Added

- Firewood log prefab is now being hooked from the beginning, meaning the firewood logs will despawn accordingly

### Changes

- MOP logs are not saved into session ID foler, instead they are called by the date time they were created in order to make it less confusing
- Framerate limiter values now range from 20 to 200
- Framerate limiter values now jump by 10, instead of by 1

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed MOP not working properly, if player is using analog controller
- Freshly spawned firewood logs should despawn correctly
- Fixed "mop generate-list" and "mop load-rules" commands not working as intended
- Possible bug fix for player dying in Satsuma from low speed impacts
- Fixed cursor showing up on MOP load screen
- Fixed a harmless error appearing on game load, if the player didn't steal the slot machine
- Fixed log folder appearing inside of mysummercar_Data, instead of the root MSC folder

### Removed

- Removed "mop sector-debug" command from the help list
