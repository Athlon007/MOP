- (MSCLoader) Added "RESOLUTION" picker from Mod Loader Pro

### Changes

### Bug Fixes

- MOP will now load successfully, if the load screen somehow didn't load
- Fixed a bug causing Satsuma to be stuck frozen, if the rule file told MOP to fully ignore Satsuma
- Fixed the "SATS_ODOMETER_RESET_FIX_ERROR", which was caused by the "Speedometer Cable" mod removing Odometer's FSM object
