MOP (Modern Optimization Plugin) is currently the ultimate performance enchancing project for My Summer Car. It is partially based off of [KruFPS](https://github.com/Krutonium/KruFPS), but optimized for even more performance. It is also the only mod, that includes [occlusion culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-surface_determination#Occlusion_culling) feature, that aims to improve the performance even more on low-end computers!

## Performance

MOP aims for the maximum performance. Compared to KruFPS, it has the object loading lag reduced to minimum.

|                 | Vanilla | KruFPS v3 |  MOP 1.0 |
|:---------------:|---------|--------|--------|
|       Home      | 25 FPS  | 35 FPS | 45 FPS |
| Driving Satsuma | 23 FPS  | 33 FPS | 40 FPS |
| Away from house | 29 FPS  | 43 FPS | 60 FPS |

Note: tested on Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air latop with Intel Core i5-8250U, 8 GB RAM and Nvidia MX150 (without Occlusion Culling).
