# Modern Optimization Plugin

<img src="icon.png" alt="icon" width=128/>

MOP (Modern Optimization Plugin) is a project which aims to make the My Summer Car game run better. It is in large part based of [KruFPS](https://github.com/Krutonium/KruFPS), but with the core of it rewritten from scratch. All that hasn't been signed by me, has been rewritten.

## Performance

MOP aims for the maximum performance. Compared to KruFPS, it has the object loading lag reduced to minimum.

|                 | Vanilla | KruFPS |  MOP |
|:---------------:|---------|--------|--------|
|       Home      | 25 FPS  | 35 FPS | 46 FPS |
| Driving Satsuma | 23 FPS  | 33 FPS | 39 FPS |
| Away from house | 29 FPS  | 43 FPS | 55 FPS |

Note: tested on Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air latop with Intel Core i5-8250U, 8 GB RAM and Nvidia MX150.

**Results may vary!**

## Requirements

- My Summer Car (newest release)

Grab the mod from [NexusMods](), or [HERE](download.zip), paste it in MSC Mod Loader Mods folder (ex. C:\Users\Athlon\Documents\MySummerCar\Mods) and start the game - that's it!

## Mod compatibility

I do not guarantee compatibility with **any** mods out there, although that doesn't mean it won't work. If there are issues with your favorite mod, you can report it.
