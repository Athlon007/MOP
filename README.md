MOP (Modern Optimization Plugin) is the ultimate performance enchancing project for My Summer Car. Seemingly improve framerate of MSC by up to 50 FPS!

The only FPS improver mod, that does all of this without any user interaction! No need to remember keybinds and select what things you want to disable at the time!

Originates from [KruFPS](https://github.com/Krutonium/KruFPS).

## Performance

MOP aims for the maximum performance. Compared to KruFPS, it has the object loading lag reduced to minimum.

|                 | Vanilla | KruFPS v3 |  MOP 2.0 |
|:---------------:|---------|--------|--------|
|       Home      | 25 FPS  | 35 FPS | 45 FPS |
| Driving Satsuma | 23 FPS  | 33 FPS | 40 FPS |
| Away from house | 29 FPS  | 43 FPS | 60 FPS |

Note: tested on Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air latop with Intel Core i5-8250U, 8 GB RAM and Nvidia MX150 (without Occlusion Culling).

Cores are extensions for the base MOP. They add additional functionality, that didn't found their way to the base MOP for various reasons.
