MOP (Modern Optimization Plugin) is the ultimate performance enhancing project for My Summer Car. Seemingly improve framerate of MSC by up to 50 FPS!

The only FPS improver mod, that does all of this without any user interaction! No need to remember keybinds and select what things you want to disable at the time!

Originates from [KruFPS](https://github.com/Krutonium/KruFPS).

## Performance

MOP aims for the maximum performance. Compared to KruFPS, it has the object loading lag reduced to minimum.

|                 | Vanilla | KruFPS v3 |  MOP 2.0 | MOP 2.7 |
|:---------------:|---------|--------|--------|--------|
|       Home      | 25 FPS  | 35 FPS | 45 FPS | 48 FPS |
| Driving Satsuma | 23 FPS  | 33 FPS | 40 FPS | 45 FPS |
| Away from house | 29 FPS  | 43 FPS | 60 FPS | 85 FPS |

Note: tested on Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air latop with Intel Core i5-8250U, 8 GB RAM and Nvidia MX150 (without Occlusion Culling).

## Questions

Got any questions? Please refer to the [FAQ](FAQ.md) first!

## Occlusion Culling

Occlusion Culling has been a feature introduced in the first Beta of MOP, and has been removed in MOP 2.2. If you want to bring it back, you can download a separete mod that adds that function back in from [Occlusion Core repository](https://github.com/Athlon007/MopOcclusionCore). Occlusion Core is not actively developed, so it may not work properly as it is.
