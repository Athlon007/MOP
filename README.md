# Modern Optimization Plugin

<img align="right" src="images/icon.png" alt="icon" width=128/>

MOP (Modern Optimization Plugin) is a project which aims to make the My Summer Car game run better. It is in large part based of [KruFPS](https://github.com/Krutonium/KruFPS), but with the core of it rewritten from scratch. All that hasn't been signed by me, has been rewritten.

## Performance

MOP aims for the maximum performance. Compared to KruFPS, it has the object loading lag reduced to minimum.

|                 | Vanilla | KruFPS v3 |  MOP Beta 1.0 |
|:---------------:|---------|--------|--------|
|       Home      | 25 FPS  | 35 FPS | 46 FPS |
| Driving Satsuma | 23 FPS  | 33 FPS | 39 FPS |
| Away from house | 29 FPS  | 43 FPS | 55 FPS |

Note: tested on Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air latop with Intel Core i5-8250U, 8 GB RAM and Nvidia MX150 (without Occlusion Culling).
