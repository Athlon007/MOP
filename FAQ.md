# Ye Olde MOP FAQ

## How can I improve the framerate even more

- Set the Active Distance to Close
- Enable 'Destroy Empty Beer Bottles' option in the MOP settings
- Removed mods that you don't really use
- Try using DirectX11, by adding the -force-d3d11 to launch options (may introduce graphical bugs)
- Try to limit the number of items in your house
- Try lowering the resolution
- Disable some options in the game:
  - Antialasing
  - Bloom
  - Reflections
  - Sunshafts
  - Sun Shadows
  - House Light Shadows
  - AI Car Dust Trails
  - Car Mirrors
- Move the vehicles or items that you don't use out of the yard

## What does it disable

- All vehicles in the game
- Many static elements of the world (such as buildings)
- Items (such as sausages)

All of them are either turned off by player approaching those items, leaving house area, or entering special sectors.

## What are sectors and where are they located

Sectors tell MOP to disable some extra elements, such as trees, foliage, buildings, AI traffic, NPCs and other stuff. These are located at:

- Yard (one at the garage, two inside of home)
- Repair shop
- Store
- Jail
- Wood chopping machine hall

## My framerate is high, but it often jumps down which I don't like

You can enable the framerate limiter in the MOP settings under the Graphics section, or simply use V-Sync.

## When I enter the Satsuma, my framerate suddenly drops down

Satsuma is the biggest resource hog of the entire game. There's literally nothing I can do about it.

## Everything disappears and reappears on game load

This is an intended behaviour.

## Mod doesn't seem to work

Make sure you have the newest version of MSC Mod Loader and MOP installed. Additionally, check if you haven't disabled some options, and that Safe Mode is toggled off.

## There's an issue with [INSERT MOD NAME HERE]

I cannot guarantee that all mods will work with MOP. But you can report what's the issue and I may look into it. Many mods do work, and some (listed on Compatibility list) received extra attention.

## Does it work with [INSERT MOD NAME HERE]

If it's listed on the Mod compatibility list - yes.

If it doesn't - perhaps, I don't know. You need to check it yourself. In most cases it will work.

## How do I install rule files from the zip file

First navigate to the folder where your MSC Mods are. Then go to:

Config -> Mod Settings -> MOP

And unpack the content of the zip file here.

## Something broke (ex. item fell through the ground after) after I teleported

I'm sorry, but I don't intend on fixing bugs involving cheat mods.

## My game stopped working/computer blew up/dog died/I started thermonuclear war because of MOP

I'm sorry to hear that! But I'm not responsible for any damage done to your computer, save game, or anything related.

## My problem is not listed here, or nothing worked

Then go ahead and report it! Please make sure it wasn't mentioned already! Also please attach the last error log (Go into mod settings and click "Open last log"), and also generate new mod report and send it too (go into mod settings and click "Generate mod report").
