# Ye Olde MOP FAQ

## Mod doesn't seem to work

Make sure you have the newest version of MSC Mod Loader and MOP installed. Additionally, check if you haven't disabled some options, and that Safe Mode is toggled off.

## There's an issue with [INSERT MOD NAME HERE]

I cannot guarantee that all mods will work with MOP. But you can report what's the issue and I may look into it. Fury, Second Ferndale and CarryMore have been fixed, so why not your mod? Please create a new issue in GitHub, or report a bug on NexusMods.

## Items are invinsible, but they seem to be still there

You most likely have Occlusion Culling turned on. Try to disable it and reload the game.

## My game stopped working/computer blew up/dog died/I started thermonuclear war because of MOP

I'm sorry to hear that! But I'm not responsible for any damage done to your computer, save game, or anything related.

## My problem is not listed here, or nothing worked

Then go ahead and report it! Please make sure it wasn't mentioned already! Also please attach the last error log (Go into mod settings and click "Open last log"), and also generate new mod report and send it too (go into mod settings and click "Generate mod report").
